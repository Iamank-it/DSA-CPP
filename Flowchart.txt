    q.draw a flowchart to print sum of two number 
    --> read a and b
    --> sum=a+b
    --> print sum

    q.draw a flowchart to find avg of two number
    --> read a and b
    --> avg=(a+b)/2
    --> print avg

    --> read p,r,t
    --> si=(p*r*t)/100
    --> print si

    q.draw a flowchart to find greater of two number 
    --> read a,b
    --> if(a>b) print a is greater 
    --> else print b is greater 

    q.draw a flowchart to find greater of three number 
    --> read a ,b,c 
    --> if (a>b & a>c) print a is greater 
    --> else if (b>a & b>c) print b is greater 
    --> else if (c>a & c>b) print c is greater

    --> read n
    --> if(n%2==0) print number is even
    --> else print number is odd

    --> read n
    --> if(n<0) print number is negetive 
    --> else if(n>0) print number is positive 
    --> else print number is zero
