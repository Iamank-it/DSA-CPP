In this course we are going to learn DSA using C++ We will be solving different Questions using 
--VS code 
--Microsoft c++
Installation of these are not explained you can refer to any youtube video 
here we will be going to solve question related to different topics of DSA
If confused you can also use your own compiler whether it is online or offline , gdb or turbo 
--No Prerequisite is required 
--Will be updated as the course carry forward

Introduction

  Language is a means of communication between two people or two individuals just like we talk to persons around us using languages like Hindi or English, or we talk with animals using sign language or gestures 
  similarly, to work with computers we also need a means to communicate with the hardware present in it. Some of the types of Computer languages are:

Low-level language 
  The code ultimately depends upon the hardware configuration and may change according to the hardware configuration of the system. 
  
It has 2 types: 
 
1.	Machine language: 
  It is used to give some information to perform any specific task written in the form of 0 or 1, there is no use of an interpreter or compiler. 
  
  Advantage:  
  a.	The execution of code is swift. 
  
  Disadvantage: 
  a.	The code depends upon the hardware configuration. 
  b.	It is not portable. 
  c.	Programmer must be an expert in coding as well as sound knowledge of hardware configuration. 
  


2.	Assembly language: 

  It requires an assembler to execute the assembly language. The execution is slower in comparison to machine language.

High-level language 
  Like English, it is easy to learn and efficient.    
      
  1.	Specific purpose language: 
    a.	ALGOL: algorithmic language 
    b.	COBOL: common business-oriented language  
    c.	FORTRAN: formulae translation 
    a special type of HLL that was used to develop the application with a specific domain area. 
    
  2.	General purpose language: 
    a.	BCPL: basic common programming language developed in 1968 in AT&T lab. it was the language in which we could develop any application related to different areas or domain 
    
  b.	CPL: common programming language  
    •	1972 
    •	also known as C 
    •	cannot develop web applications. 
    we can develop different types of applications/software like system applications, and utility software.  
   

Error and its types 
It is the human mistake while writing the code that prevents one program from normal execution. 
if the error exists (semantic, syntax, logical) then our program cannot run smoothly without debugging. 
1. Compile time error: 
    It is the error that has been generated during the compilation of the program 
    Such error will be generated due to: 
        a. Syntax error: 
              It is the type of error that has been produced when the 
programmers do not strictly follow the programming construct. 
        b. Semantic error: 
              It is the error that has been generated due to spelling mistakes in  
              keyword and predefined function. 
2. Runtime error: 
    It is the error that has been generated during the execution of the program 
    Such type of error is generated due to the logical mistake of the programmer.
